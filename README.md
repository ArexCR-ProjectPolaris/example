<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

In this section, please explain what major libraries were used to perform your simulations. 
For Python, any libraries that are not in the standard Anaconda pre-installed packages should be listed in a file called ```environments_[file_name].yml```. This will allow others to create the exact environment you used to run your simulation and ensures cross compatibility.
Follow a similar format if you use a different language.

To install libraries in Anaconda, please see the Anaconda distribution documentation.

In general, a new environment should be used when using any combination of third party libraries for a new simulation to ensure version cross compatibility.

```yml``` files can be extracted from your anaconda environment.

### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct users on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Enter your API in `config.js`
   ```js
   const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
   ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Use this space to show useful examples of how a project can be used. Additional screenshots, code examples and demos work well in this space. You may also link to more resources.

You should also briefly cover the expected inputs and outputs of your program. Please keep it short as most of the details will be in the documentation. Generally, just make a short list.

_For more information, please refer to the [Documentation](https://example.com)_

<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->
## Contributing
This section will be standardized for all projects. We most likely will provide an additional document to cover this. In short, we acknowledge the benefits of open source software development. However, these repositories are the product of our team's work. If you'd like to contribute, we'd invite you to join Project Polaris.

For project members, we will outline the procedure for contributing your code to a repository the basic idea is as follows:
1. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
2. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
3. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
4. Open a Pull Request
